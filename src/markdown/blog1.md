<h2>Just remember</h2>

<p>Stress is everywhere in these current times, it's unavoidable, that's for certain. No mean to scare you, but only prepare you for a life we should all be living more peacefully, not only with each other, but with ourselves ("deep I know"). I recommend we all take a deep look and realize how simple life can be if we all just take a breath! (Too farfetched?")</p>
<p>I hope you leave today with a feeling of accomplishment in ones inner self. It's too easy to fall under the pressure of today's society, and I am here, to tell you, NO MORE!</p>
<p>You are amazing the way you are. You are beautiful, and most importantly, you are loved.</p>
<p>Enjoy the rest of the app and please don't forget to breathe.</p>
